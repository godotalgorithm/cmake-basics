# cmake-basics
This is a basic CMake example for the 2020 MolSSI winter bootcamp,
with a minimal Makefile for in-source building and a minimal CMakelists.txt for out-of-source building.
We will improve this minimal example as a hands-on exercise to highlight proper usage and useful features of CMake.
